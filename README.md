# [Project 1: UFC Fighter Image Classification](https://github.com/jwchoi622/fighterClassification)
* The 5 fighters used were Conor McGregor, Jon Jones, Sean O'Malley, Chael Sonnen and Daniel Cormier

* **Deep Learning Framework:** Developed a deep learning model using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning techniques.

* **Data Preprocessing:** Utilized image data preprocessing techniques, including data augmentation with ImageDataGenerator, and normalized pixel values to enhance model accuracy.

* **Model Architecture:** Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers, showcasing expertise in neural network architecture design.

* **Performance Evaluation:** Trained and evaluated the model over 20 epochs, monitoring training and validation accuracy and loss, demonstrating the ability to assess model performance and optimize hyperparameters.

* **Visualization:** Visualized the training process by plotting training and validation accuracy and loss, allowing for clear and insightful analysis of model training results.

* **Model Persistence:** Stored the mapping of face classes and their corresponding IDs using Python's pickle library, highlighting data management skills.

* **Project Documentation:** Demonstrated proficiency in documenting and explaining the project steps, from data preprocessing to model architecture, in a clear and organized manner.

# [Project 2: House Price Regression](https://github.com/jwchoi622/housePricing)
* **Data Exploration and Analysis:** Conducted thorough data exploration by examining summary statistics, identifying missing values, and investigating the relationships between various features and the target variable (SalePrice).

* **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employed a variety of regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The best models were identified based on the root mean square error (RMSE).

* **Feature Engineering:** Engineered new features, such as property age, total living area, and total bathrooms, to improve model accuracy and capture valuable insights into housing prices. Categorical variables were appropriately encoded for modeling.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction to reduce multicollinearity and enhance the efficiency of regression models while maintaining predictive performance.

* **Ensemble Modeling:** Employed ensemble techniques by combining predictions from different models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Multilayer Perceptron Regressor) to create a more robust and accurate final prediction.
