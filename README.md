# [Project 1: UFC Fighter Image Classification](https://github.com/jwchoi622/fighterClassification)
* Used Convolutional Neural Networks to build a Image Classification model
* The 5 fighters used were Conor McGregor, Jon Jones, Sean O'Malley, Chael Sonnen and Daniel Cormier
* Developed a deep learning model using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning techniques.
* Utilized image data preprocessing techniques, including data augmentation with ImageDataGenerator, and normalized pixel values to enhance model accuracy.
* Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers, showcasing expertise in neural network architecture design.
* Trained and evaluated the model over 20 epochs, monitoring training and validation accuracy and loss, demonstrating the ability to assess model performance and optimize hyperparameters.

# [Project 2: House Price Regression](https://github.com/jwchoi622/housePricing)
* Conducted thorough data exploration by examining summary statistics, identifying missing values and investigating the relationships between various features and the target variable.
* Employed a variety of regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost while also performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The best models were identified based on root mean square error (RMSE)
* Engineered new features such as property age, total living area, and total bathrooms to improve model accuracy and capture valuable insights into housing prices.
* Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to reduce multicollinearity and enhance the efficiency of regression models while maintaining predictive performance.
