# [Project 3: House Price Regression](https://github.com/jwchoi622/housePricing)
* Analyzed the dataset with different visualizations to better understand the data
* Looked at different models before choosing the best model to predict house prices. 
* Used RMSE to look at the performance of Random Forest, Linear Regression and XGBoost
